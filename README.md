# 🔍 Shortest Path POC

This project demonstrates parsing a custom XML topology to build a directed graph and compute the **shortest path** between two entities using Node.js.

---

## 📦 Features

- XML parsing based on a custom XSD schema
- Entity classification and association mapping
- Directed graph construction
- Shortest path computation using Breadth-First Search (BFS)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone, install, and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjayphpdev/shortest-path

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
cd shortest-path

### 3. Install Dependencies
npm install

### 4. Run the POC
npm run dev

---

### 🧪 Usage
After running the project, the console will output:
1. Parsed entities and associations
2. Constructed graph
3. Shortest path from a from node to a to node

---

### 🔁 Customization
To test different nodes for the shortest path:
1. Open index.js
2. Modify the following lines:
const from = "X7898980";
const to = "T/2345";
3. Save and re-run the project:
npm run dev

---

### XML File Format for data input
Refer attached sample within root directory (example.xml)

---

📌 Notes
- This is a simple proof-of-concept.
- Associations are unidirectional (from primary to secondary).
- Entities must have unique keys across all classes.
